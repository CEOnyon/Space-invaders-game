Space Invaders
I made the classic game Space Invaders with JavaScript on a HTML canvas, and used CSS.

Description
In this game we have our enemies at the top of the screen; they move side to side and down towards the player. At random the enemies will shoot bullets. At the bottom of the screen we have our spaceship which can shoot at the enemies. The objective is to stay alive, avoid the enemy bullets and eliminate the enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.

How To Play
Use the left key to go left.
Use the right key to go right.
Use the Space bar to shoot.

I covered some of the folling topics and more:
